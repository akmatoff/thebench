# A quiet place in the web

A real-time, shared virtual space where strangers gather, coexist and simply be. 
Built with presence and poetry in mind.

## Vision and Inspiration

I always wanted to express myself through art and technology. The bench is not a game. There's no goal, no need to perform, speak or entertain.
I dreamed of creating a small place in the web where people could share a moment of presence with strangers - no profiles, no chat, no goals and no expectations. Instead, connection happens through subtle gestures and shared experiences. Everything else is left to feeling.

### Why "The Bench"?

Because some of my most meaningful moments have been spent on ordinary benches - talking with friends until sunrise, sharing silence, watching the world go by. They were not just a furniture. They have heard our stories, dreams, fears, cries, laughter and jokes. They have been our witness.
This project is my way of sharing this experience in an interesting, digital way and offering that feeling to others.

## Tech Stack 
**Backend**: Go (with Gorilla Websocket for real-time sync)
**Frontend**: TypeScript (with Pixi.js, canvas-based and animated)

This is a work in progress.
I'm still building toward the vision, slowly.
